# TRE-FX

_Delivering a federated network of TREs to enable safe analytics_

<a href="img/dare-fx-draft-logo.svg"><img src="img/dare-fx-draft-logo.svg" alt="TRE-FX, delivering a federated network of TREs to enable safe analytics" /></a>

TRE-FX is a project funded by [UKRI](https://www.ukri.org/) Medical Research Council [MRC](https://www.ukri.org/councils/mrc/) and [DARE UK](https://dareuk.org.uk/) for the call [‚ÄúInform design of cross-council trusted research environments‚Äù](https://www.ukri.org/opportunity/inform-design-of-cross-council-trusted-research-environments/).


## Motivation

Trusted Research Environments (TREs) are secure locations in which data are placed
for researchers to analyse. They host administrative data, hospital data or any other
data that must be securely isolated and only accessible for approved queries by
approved researchers. 

However, _it is hard for a researcher to perform analysis across
multiple TREs_, for example when data is to be analysed across geographical or
governance boundaries, such as the devolved nature of healthcare in the United
Kingdom. _Yet this ability is urgently needed_. 

Analysis across a federation of TREs
would enable timely analysis of UK wide scattered data to answer urgent questions,
as we needed in the COVID-19 pandemic. The technologies and standards we need to be able to do this are available now. They
do not need to be invented. 

**TRE-FX** is assembling leading technology providers from
[ELIXIR-UK](https://elixiruknode.org/) and [HDR UK](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/), 
with three TRE providers and two leading analysis platforms
to show through a real reference implementation how we can use secure Research
Objects to move between TREs while still supporting the **Five Safes principles** that
govern and protect patient data; all overseen by patient representatives.

The impact will be a step change for how researchers can safely combine data from
many sources, and for how data providers from any sector can safely implement this
using technology and standards we already have today.

## Implementation plan

<a href="/assets/img/architecture.svg"><img src="img/implementation.svg" alt="Five Safes Queries go to Submission layer, polled by TRE polling Layer. It authenticates the query before queing it, to be picked up by the Controlled Layer inside the Trusted Research Infrastructure. The workflow is executed using WfExS (workflow execution service) with results as an RO-Crate, checked for disclosure control. Results propagate upwards to the Five Safe Results API and submitted through the Transparancy Layer to the HDR Data Use Register." /></a>

1. User submit queries as job packets in a Five Safes RO-Crate via an API on a publicly available Submission portal. Queries are then presented on a query queue.
2. The job packets are pulled down into a demilitarised polling zone on a TRE via a secure outbound only API connection. Connection between TREs and the Submission Layer are managed by HUTCH.
3. Job packets are authenticated and then presented on an internal queue. 
4. A second outbound only API pulls the job packets into the main Controlled zone of the TRE. 
5. The job packet is passed to WfExS which executes published approved workflows on data, generate results and adds them to the job packet, including workflow information and providence. 	
6. Subject to appropriate disclose control the job packet is returned to the TRE Polling zone and stored. 
7. Further disclosure checks are applied, and the job packet is released back to the submission layer where it is held on a results queue to be collected by the user.
8. Subject to deidentification, the job packet is also published on the HDR data use register.
