# TRE-FX website

This is the Markdown/Jekyll source for the [TRE-FX project](https://trefx.uk/).

See https://elixir-belgium.github.io/elixir-toolkit-theme/ for documentation on how to use this Jekyll theme, and [intro to Markdown](
https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) for the syntax used.

In general, add a new page under `pages/` and then add it to one of the [menues](https://github.com/trefx/trefx.github.io/tree/main/_data) and/or link to it from existing pages.

## Contributing

If you have already been added to the [trefx GitHub org](https://github.com/trefx) you can edit the `*.md` Markdown pages directly. 

An automatic [GitHub Action](https://github.com/trefx/trefx.github.io/actions) should then publish your changes on <https://trefx.uk/> after a few minutes. Watch the workflow progress for any error messages.

For larger changes, or if you don't have GitHub write access, create a [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests), e.g. by clicking "Edit" button on the file using GitHub. This allows the changed to be reviewed before it is live on the Wbsite.
